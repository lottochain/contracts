Therefore, each LOTTO Token you hold will be valid until it is drawn. Eeach LOTTO token represents the certainty of winning a prize, once. Note that if you move the token between wallets, the system will track it and deliver the eventually drawn prize to the new wallet or owner. In other words, you will be able to negotiate the LOTTO token too, since there is a limited suply of 300,000 units, and lots of pairs to trade at HTMLBunker Exchange.</p><p>Obs: On March 2020, Super Ticket Tokens will be avaliable for Htmlbunker Founding Members only, as part of our campaign among them.
